#  Electronic medical records and telemedicine

## Innovate developing country healthcare system

Gone are the days when the only option for the health care system data storing was writing patientsâ€™ medical information on paper and storing them alphabetically in a room full of shelves. Now with the help of technology medical records can be stored on a computer making it easy to access, few of errors and reducing tasks force. 

Electronic medical record (EMR) is a digital version of the paper charts in a medical facilities. It is used by healthcare providers to keep and maintain patient health information(medical history, medications, lab results, and treatment plan). EMRs can improve the efficiency and quality of care by making it easier to access and share patient information, as well as by providing alerts and reminders to help prevent errors. 

The use of technology, like, internet, video conferencing, electronic home monitor to provide remote medical services, such as diagnoses, consultation and treatment, to patients is called Telemedicine . It allows healthcare providers to remotely assess, diagnose, and treat patients, regardless of their physical location. This can include things like virtual consultations with a doctor, remote monitoring of vital signs, or sending electronic prescriptions. Telemedicine can also facilitate communication between healthcare providers and improve the coordination of care for patients. It has the potential to improve access to healthcare, particularly in remote or underserved areas, and it helps reduce the need for patients to travel to see a healthcare provider, giving the patients more resting time.
